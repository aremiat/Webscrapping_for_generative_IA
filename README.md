# Webscrapping_for_generative_IA


This project is designed to scrape and download PDF reports from the Allianz Trade website.
It extracts relevant information such as titles and publication dates, formats them, and saves the PDFs in a structured folder format for further use in generative AI applications.

The PDFs collected through this web scraping project are used by a generative AI, which reads and analyzes the content automatically.
The AI processes each report, understands its key information, and generates a clear and concise summary.
This allows for quick handling of large volumes of financial and economic data, providing relevant insights without the need to manually go through the entire documents.
